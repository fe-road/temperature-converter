# Temperature Converter

## What is it?

This is sample project for the Frontend Road course: "Road to First Job".

The aim is to help practicing some basic concepts of JavaScript seen so far, like functions, conditionals, loops, etc.

## Project Definition

The converter should allow the user to send to a specific function 3 arguments:

- The value to convert
- The unit to convert from
- The unit to convert to

The units can be Celsius, Fahrenheit or Kelvin and all values must be validated in order to be reasonable values (-300 Celsius can not be accepted, for example).

### Examples and expected answers:

```
convertTemperature(40, "C", "K") --> 313.15
convertTemperature(35, "C", "F") --> 95
convertTemperature(70, "F", "K") --> 294.261
```
